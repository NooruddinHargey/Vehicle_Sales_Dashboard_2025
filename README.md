# Vehicle Sales Dashboard 2025

## 📊 Project Overview

This project showcases a Tableau dashboard analyzing South African vehicle sales for 2025, focusing on brand performance, payment types (Cash vs Finance), and local vs export unit trends.

The dataset was sourced from **NAAMSA** (National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa) and consolidated into a single CSV. Some missing monthly figures were **interpolated** to create a continuous dataset. As a result, figures may not be 100% exact and are intended to **demonstrate analytical, data cleaning, and visualization skills** rather than serve as official statistics.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate practical data analysis workflow: preparing raw data, building clear visualizations, and presenting insights in a business-friendly dashboard.
